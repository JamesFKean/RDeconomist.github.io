This is the site I used to trial code, and to demonstrate Data Science and visualisation techniques.

It is hosted at www.rapidcharts.io

The majority of the charts are written in Vega-Lite. https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/

Please feel free to use any of the data or charts. Let me know if you do!
